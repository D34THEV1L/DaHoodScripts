# Biography.
I am a beginner programmer from Mexico who was interested in programming to exploit roblox and learned some basic programming thanks to it, now I want to focus on creating games on the roblox platform. Here is some of the code I stole and fixed from Da Hood. Enjoy. And if you don't know English, this was translated by google

# Support.
It is recommended that the scripts run on KRNL, Synapse X, ScriptWare, Fluxus or Oxygen U. Don't use JJSploit or any exploit that uses the WRD (WereAreDevs) API, it's also terrible and has a reputation for malware.
